# FSFinance

The idea of FSFinance is to create a program that helps one to keep track of her/his
daily expenses. The program is WIP with no determined project deadline. In its
first iterations FSFinance will only be realized as a Web application. Later
iterations will add additional features and/or an Android companion app.

The repository called 'FSFinance-WebApp' refers to the Web Application. The (future)
repository 'FSFinance-Android' refers to the Android companion app.
