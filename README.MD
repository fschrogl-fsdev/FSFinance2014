# FSFinance

The idea of FSFinance is to create a program that helps one to keep track of her/his
daily expenses. The program is WIP with no determined project deadline. In its
first iterations FSFinance will only be realized as a Web application. Later
iterations will add additional features and/or an Android companion app.

The repository called 'FSFinance-WebApp' refers to the Web Application. The (future)
repository 'FSFinance-Android' refers to the Android companion app.

## Maven License Plugin

The Maven license plugin provides a convenient way for checking/adding/removing
license headers to/from source files. The plugin is linked to Maven's verify
phase and can also be invoked explicitly with the following commands:

<pre>
   mvn license:check
   mvn license:format
   mvn license:remove
</pre>
